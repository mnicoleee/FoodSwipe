# FoodSwipe
By: Mary Nicole Tangog 

Purpose: 
------------------------------------------------------------------------
The purpose of this app is to help users and give different options of 
food and a list of some restaurants in the Bay Area. As someone who is 
very indecisive on what to eat when going out, my friends and I take so 
long to decide, that sometimes the restaurants end up closing. Being able
to swipe through different food options can help narrow down some choices. 

Features:
------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Have a card stack with different images of food options.
* There is a title and description on the bottom of the screen for each food card.
* Users are able to swipe right to move on to the next card.
* Users are able to swipe left to move back to the previous cards. 
* There will descriptions on each card giving some examples of restaurants. 

If error occur due to CardSlider:
------------------------------------------------------------------------
  1) open terminal
  2) open (cd) to FoodSwipe folder
  3) run >> pod init
  4) open podfile, it should have ---> pod 'CardSlider'
  5) then run >> pod install
 this should fix the issue.
